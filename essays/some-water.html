      <h2>Some water in between</h2>
      <h5>02/11/2019</h5>
      <p>
        Almost three years later, I’m sitting in the place where I first saw
        him. A cozy but crowded café, immersed in the noise of the espresso
        machines working non-stop, helping to quiet my thoughts, like it did
        back then.
        <br />
        <br />
        He was not tall and had dark, black hair, with a thick, perfectly shaped
        beard, but none of that I noticed first. I saw his eyes, childish and
        playful. As he got closer, I saw the brown of his irises, the hint of
        gold and honey, long lashes framing them and brushing the air. I could
        see a spark when the skin around those eyes wrinkled and his full lips
        curved into a smile to show his perfect teeth. He was suddenly standing
        in front of me and nothing would ever be the same. That much I knew. 
        <br />
        <br />
        As our millennial generation often do, we met online, on a weekend when
        I was visiting Copenhagen, and we started texting when I was already on
        my way back home to Aarhus, two hundred miles away and some water in
        between. We should have stopped there, but we didn’t, and soon it was
        too late. 
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>Sergio, 29</em></strong>
        <br />
        <em
          >(Argentinian flag) (Danish flag) Spontaneous? Yes! Salsa dancing?
          Yes! Red wine? Yes!</em
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        (That’s as much as I can remember from his profile, particularly because
        I love to dance, but I’m not the spontaneous type and red wine gives me
        headaches).  
        <br />
        <br />
        He had just come back from a month in Colombia and we found common
        ground right away. I think he stopped reading after seeing the word
        “Colombia” in my profile and didn’t realize for a couple of days that we
        actually didn’t live in the same city. Still, we exchanged messages for
        two or three weeks, probably thinking that we could just be friends,
        have someone to speak the same language with and share our similar
        cultures. But during those first weeks, and without really knowing how
        or when, the relationship transitioned into something else. We would
        text every day first thing in the morning, right before falling asleep
        at night, and every hour in between. He was so quick to tell me
        everything about him, while I was taking everything in. We flirted, we
        joked, we shared, and the tone of the messages started changing and
        becoming closer, more affectionate, more caring, more intimate, even
        though we were never very explicit about it. Less than a month later I
        was back in Copenhagen to see him in person. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I waited for him in my favorite cafe, with my eyes glued to my book,
        going over and over the same page, while my head was somewhere else
        fighting to stay calm. My hands were cold, even when I wrapped them
        around a cup of hot coffee, and my heart was beating faster in
        anticipation. I pretended not to see him through the window when he
        first approached the entrance, but I saw him, and I followed him all the
        way in, my book still keeping me safe. 
        <br />
        <br />
        He saw me and we knew each other right away. We embraced and it was like
        meeting an old friend. He sat and told me about his day while I finished
        my drink. Casually. Like old friends do.
        <br />
        <br />
        Later on, we went for a long walk in the cold and windy air of the
        Danish winter and immersed ourselves in deep conversation. He talked. A
        lot and fast, in his melodic Argentinian accent. Oh how I loved that
        accent. He had a cold and his voice was raspy. He looked sick and tired,
        his eyes red, but he never mentioned it and we stayed out late,
        finishing the night with a beer (I can’t stand beer, but I didn’t care).
        I was mesmerized, enchanted, and listened. A lot and slow. But most of
        all, we laughed. Belly-aching, eyes-tearing laugh. Our sense of humor
        was so easy and in tune. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I left early the next morning, back to my life two hundred miles away,
        leaving behind what I thought had ended with a good night hug. But
        didn’t.  
        <br />
        <br />
        Today, almost three years later, sitting in that cafe where I first saw
        him, I remember those two years. That’s how long we were together.
        That’s how long we were apart. Two years of memories and so many of them
        are scattered around this city. Walking around these past days during my
        weekend visit, everything reminded me of him. Of us. Everything we
        gained and lost. Everything that was and now isn’t. Him. Me. Us. And
        some water in between.
