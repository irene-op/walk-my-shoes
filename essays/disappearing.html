      <h2>Disappearing</h2>
      <p>
        -Why are you so quiet? -Are you okay? Shyness can mean feeling
        uncomfortable, self-conscious, nervous, bashful, timid, or insecure.
        People who feel shy sometimes notice physical sensations like blushing
        or feeling speechless, shaky, or breathless. Shyness is the opposite of
        being at ease with yourself around others. Being quiet in a loud world.
        Highly sensitive person â†’ Feeling too much and not having the tools to
        deal with those emotions made me numb. I followed the crowds because I
        didn't know better. I wanted so badly to be liked and accepted, to
        belong, but I didn't have the words. I never did. So I stayed quiet and
        learned to be nice, sweet and polite. A good girl. Maybe they will like
        that. Imagine this little kid absorbing everything around her. She's not
        being seen, so she just observes, takes it in. Everything. For years.
        Taking it in. And when she doesn't recognise any of that as her own, she
        puts it aside, holds on to it. What else could she do? For years. Taking
        it in. That's why the little things seem so big. I trapped myself inside
        my own head and body and locked down. All contained. I quieted my voice
        until I had none. I muted myself. But quiet is invisible, and that's how
        I disappeared.
