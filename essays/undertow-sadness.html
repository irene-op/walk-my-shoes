      <h2>The Undertow of Sadness</h2>
      <h5>05/10/2019</h5>
      <p>
        I had left my home in Colombia three years ago and since then I had been
        living day by day and never knowing what would come six months ahead. A
        year in a small university city in Denmark, six months in Italy and then
        back for another year in Copenhagen. I found myself newly graduated,
        unemployed and absolutely in love with the city. A world full of
        possibilities waiting for a plan.
        <br />
        <br />
        Finding a job had proven to be a difficult task and when my one way to
        stay in the country was to move to the other side of it and start over,
        that was exactly what I did. Accepting a job in a multinational company
        and moving to a city with 75,000 people, from which I knew exactly 0,
        sounded like a good enough plan. (Note that I’m pointing out the
        population because, while for some people it might sound like a
        reasonable number, for someone who grew up in a city with five million
        people, this was a small town). I figured I could always go back to
        Copenhagen (a its 777,218 people) once I had some work experience and
        mastered the language.
        <br />
        <br />
        I was beaming with excitement and joy towards the unknown. Pack a few
        boxes, throw them in the car and drive. For the first time in my life I
        was living completely on my own and by my own rules. During the first
        week I made it a point to leave clothes all over the place and not clean
        up after myself, just because I could. It was liberating. I slept on an
        air mattress for a few nights while I waited for my order from Ikea to
        arrive and started my new routine. Wake up, bike to the train station,
        take the train, change onto a bus, enter the office and feel lost and
        overwhelmed with new information for the next eight hours. Then I'd go
        home, go to bed and repeat back. And back. And back.
        <br />
        <br />
        This new commuting routine (30km each way every day) became my main
        social experience of the day. The same people, taking the same train,
        going the same way. Conversation was bound to happen and new connections
        were made. Most of us were not Danish so we all went out of our way to
        be social, meet people, stay busy and avoid loneliness at all costs. And
        I went with it for a few months, but after a while it became too much to
        bare. Or maybe just not enough. As a true introvert my energy comes from
        my alone time. I hate being with people only to avoid being alone,
        making conversation only to avoid silence. I craved real connection and
        couldn’t find it. If I had to tell one more person where I was from and
        how long I had been in Denmark, I would bang my head into a wall. I
        can’t build relationships based solely on the fear of boredom and
        loneliness, because for the most part, I don’t suffer from this. I can
        fill my days with books, movies, music, online courses, sports, gym,
        art. And that was why isolating myself was so easy.
        <br />
        <br />
        Six months had passed and it all suddenly hit me. This was not
        temporary. This was my life now. This small town, with two bars, three
        restaurants with the same pizzas, three H&Ms, one MacDonald’s, two
        7Eleven, my favorite cafe that was never open, one movie theater, one
        mall and five gyms. My life had now been reduced to a 3 kilometers
        radius and I felt the walls closing around me.
        <br />
        <br />
        I can’t really point out where, when or how it started. That winter was
        tough. They all were. Dark and cold, I felt heavy, slow, dragging, so
        tired. Waking up was painful. I felt as if I had a brick pushing down on
        my chest. I couldn’t breathe. I would gather absolutely every bit of
        strength I had to push myself out of bed, and then there was nothing
        left to face the day. Every day. Then my mood was also dark, and cold. I
        couldn’t find joy in anything, or a good reason to move. And people.
        There was no energy for people, so I stayed away.
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s such an underwhelming feeling, looking around and knowing that you
        have every reason for happiness, you are so lucky, you have so much, but
        you are so sad. And you can see the good, but you can’t feel it. So you
        tell yourself to pull it together, toughen up, be the strong woman
        you’re supposed to be, push forward, don’t whine. Crying is for the
        weak.
        <br />
        <br />
        And weak I was, or so I felt. I woke up crying and couldn’t stop for the
        whole day. I had to hide in a conference room and blame my red eyes on
        the cold winter air.
        <br />
        <br />
        It took me a while to make the decision to get some help. At some point
        I figured that talking about it might help, if not to fix it at least to
        understand what was happening and why. I have never been good at
        expressing my emotions or talking about my feelings, so this decision
        was already a hard one. I couldn’t bring myself to talk about all this
        with my friends. I didn’t want to burden them with what seemed like a
        child’s problem. “You’re sad. Big deal. Who isn’t”, I imagined them
        saying.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some days later I went to see a doctor, who hopefully would refer me to
        a psychologist. She gave me a piece of paper with some questions: are
        you feeling down, depressed, hopeless? Check. Have you had little
        interest or pleasure in doing things? Check. Are you having trouble
        sleeping or sleeping too much? Check. Are you overeating? Check. Are you
        feeling tired, with little energy? Check, check, check. The verdict: I
        had a mild depression.
        <br />
        <br />
        “So, what problem can I help you with?”, Karen, my new psychologist,
        said right after seating and saying our names. I was puzzled about the
        question, even though I saw it coming. My head was flooded with emotions
        and I didn’t know where to begin. I could only think about a bunch of
        little things that piled up and became my reasons for crying, and in
        thinking about this, my problems felt, yet again, so insignificant. I
        couldn’t believe I needed help, that I couldn’t deal with that on my
        own. I couldn’t believe I had to say it outloud. Make them real.
        <br />
        <br />
        “I’m here because I feel so alone. I also don’t want to be with anyone”,
        I think I started. I told her my story, what had led me to be sitting in
        front of her then and I cried. She kept asking me where in my body I was
        feeling my emotions while telling her about my experiences. I tried
        telling her I didn’t, but she kept pushing. I started blurting out body
        parts for the sake of finishing the sessions. Don’t get me wrong, I know
        she meant well, and for someone else the exercise probably makes sense,
        but I just needed to talk and once I did, I was done with that. I wasn’t
        very convinced about her methods, but I was aware that it would take
        time and work, so I saw her a few more times after this.
        <br />
        <br />
        Emotionally, I started feeling better, lighter. Physically, I was still
        dragging my feet where I needed to stand. I felt drained. It was time
        for another appointment, but this time I needed someone familiar, who
        knew me and understood my context. Who spoke my own language. I skyped
        with the daughter of one of my parents’ best friends, who is a
        psychiatrist. Our families have known each other forever and we used to
        play together as kids.
        <br />
        <br />
        “We need to make your brain chemistry right again,” she said. “If you
        agree, I would suggest you start taking some medication. It’s a mild
        antidepressant, with no significant side effects and no risk of
        addiction. We can evaluate in a couple of months how you tolerate it and
        if that is the right course of treatment.”
        <br />
        <br />
        I can’t tell if it was the placebo effect, the idea that there was some
        hope of getting better, but just a few days after starting the
        medication I could already feel a difference. My energy was slowly
        coming back, but more importantly, my mood was improving too. I was
        feeling like myself again, I was feeling present.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since that first time some years ago now, these symptoms of fatigue will
        come and go, and I usually panic a little when they do because I
        remember how bad it can get and how it all starts with me being tired.
        Is it normal? Am I doing too much? Is it time to slow down? Or, am I
        heading back into depression? I quickly move into my self-care mode
        before it gets worse. Yoga, meditation, longer sleep, alone time, fresh
        air, candles, deep breaths. It helps.
        <br />
        <br />
        It has been a hard thing to go through, but it has forced me to go
        deeper into my life now and everything before, find the root cause of
        all this pain and work on getting better. It has made me aware of who I
        am, what I want and what I need; aware of everything around me. I
        reflect more, feel more, feel better. It has also been a lesson on
        generosity and compassion towards others and on the notion that we don’t
        know what goes on behind the picture-perfect facades we try so hard to
        put up for show. We all come with some baggage, carry our own burdens
        and fight desperately to stay afloat. Every day is a reminder to be
        gentle, to be kind, to myself and others.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have also become a firm believer in small pleasures, in looking for
        happiness and satisfaction in details, the small moments and gestures.
        In giving significance to what would otherwise just pass us by. In
        making everything count.
        <br />
        <br />
        I live a fairly alone life, but that has been a choice, trying to stay
        true to my needs and giving myself enough space to be who I want to be,
        and that feeling of loneliness doesn’t get me too often. When it does, I
        hold on as tight as I can to the love around me, to the people who
        matter and the little things that give me a sense of peace and make me
        smile. It often comes during the colder and darker months and I know to
        prepare for this. Make sure I’m emotionally strong for when this arrives
        so that it doesn’t wash me over and drown me with its waves. Make sure I
        can resurface and stand strong without too much sorrow.
