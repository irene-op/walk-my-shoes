        These were Glennon Doyle’s words talking about her early sobriety, and I
        thought “this is exactly how I’ve been feeling”. Except I barely drink,
        I don’t do drugs, or gamble. My addiction, my escape, what kept me numb,
        I realised, was a chronic case of people pleasing. The strong believe
        that I needed to be liked and fit in. Be accommodating. That everyone
        else mattered but me. She continues saying that she hasn’t been “fine”
        since she stopped drinking, because she was finally living. Being alive
        means feeling, the good and the bad. For me, it was as if I had been
        just floating through life for years but never really living. How do you
        go on for so long without actually living? And so you never become
        anyone. You just exist and make decisions based on existing, to keep
        existing. And it’s not happy, it’s not fulfilling, but you don’t know,
        because that is your reality. It has always been. And when you finally
        wake up and see and feel for the first time, it’s so overwhelming, and
        you don’t know what to do with all that. You need to process and
        uncover, discover and for the first time choose. Choose for the person
        you are meant to be. This is where this space was born.
