        I created this space for honesty, vulnerability, empathy and compassion.
        For free expression of things I have kept to myself for too long. But
        above all, for understanding, discovery, healing and growth, in an
        attempt to find my voice, recover things that I have lost on the way
        through life and build some new ones.
        <br />
        <br />
        What you'll find here are all my own words, thoughts, feelings and
        reflections. It's raw, personal, and absolutely terrifying to share, but
        I have chosen to do so. To unburden myself of years of carrying the
        weight of my emotions, but also with the hope that some of it will
        resonate with others and encourage deeper connections and conversations.
        Because if I have learned something in the past years of my own search
        is that some emotions, situations and responses are universal; that we
        all have our own world of trauma and drama and pain and joy and success
        and we are all looking for a way to make it through, to heal, to evolve
        and to move forward.
        <br />
        <br />
        Things might seem a little scattered around here, because that's how my
        thoughts are at the moment. I'm hoping that the more I write, the more
        context I'll provide, and that the more you read, the more you will be
        able to understand where I'm coming from. Most of the essays are still
        draft versions -if I aimed for perfection I would never share- and the
        blog posts are written on the spot or edited versions of my morning
        pages and notes I keep on my phone. The poems are usually quick ideas
        that come to my mind when I'm too tired to think about it but have a lot
        to say.
